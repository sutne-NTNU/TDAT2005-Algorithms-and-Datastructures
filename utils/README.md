# Utils

These are some small methods that i use several times in this course. I have created:

## ColourPrint

Ease of use methods for printing in different colours to the console. Very helpful to declutter the console and put emphasis on the important parts. 

## Queue


## Program

Couple methods for easy handling of Thread.sleep and closing resources.
