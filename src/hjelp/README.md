# Utils
These are some small methods that i use several times in this course. I have created:
## Colourprint
Two ease of use methods for printing in different colours to the console. Very helpful to declutter the console and put emphasis on the important parts.

## Queue


## Program
Just a few methods to avoid messy try-catch statements when i for instance what a thread.sleep ore for closing a resource.
